# Omni_robot_dynamics_PID
This Mathematica notebook provides development of a Forward Kinematic model, Inverse Kinematic Model, and Dynamic model using Kane's method of a Universal Omni Wheeled mobile robot. Also, a PID trajectory tracking controller was developed to track different trajectories with very small error.
